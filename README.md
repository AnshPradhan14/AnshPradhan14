# 👋 Hey there, I’m Ansh Pradhan!

🎓 I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student with a major in AI — constantly experimenting with code, models, and occasionally, my sleep schedule.  
🧠 I love building smart solutions that actually solve problems — whether it's predicting stock prices or detecting faces in real time (no, I’m not spying).  
⚙️ Passionate about AI, ML, deep learning, data analysis, and anything Python-flavored.

## 🚀 What I Do (Other than Procrastinate Productively)
- 📊 Built a stock prediction model that’s more accurate than my own life predictions (R² = 0.9983).  
- 🧠 Created a real-time age & gender detection system — it’s not biased, it just knows you're 22 pretending to be 18.  
- 📦 Worked on secure password generators, BMI predictors, weather apps, and more during my Python Developer internship.  
- 🤝 As VP of the Computer Society & Gaming Club, I organized events that got people coding, collaborating, and sometimes crying over bugs together.

## 😄 Fun Facts

→ I can sleep 20 hours straight — not lazy, just in power-saving mode.  
→ I turn last-minute panic into coding marathons (and surprisingly good results).  
→ I’m equally excited by cricket highlights and hyperparameter tuning.  
→ Debugging is my cardio (because running actual miles sounds like a lot).
